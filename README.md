# My study of scala language

Here are the exercises (without assigments) I did during the Scala
specialization in Coursera:

* **Course 1**: [Functional Programming in Scala](https://www.coursera.org/learn/progfun1)
* **Course 2**: [Functional Program Design in Scala](https://www.coursera.org/learn/progfun2)

> I am on the first course yet.
